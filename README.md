CitySync: Concept & Purpose
CitySync is a social discovery app that helps people share and explore experiences across cities. Instead of relying on generic guides, users can learn directly from each other about restaurants, parks, museums, and hidden gems — much like word-of-mouth recommendations, but in digital form.

Key Features
    1. Profiles (Share & Connect)
        ◦ Users have profiles where they can share favorite places and connect with others who share similar interests.
    2. Review Locations
        ◦ Users can write reviews about different places and include text, photos, or videos.
    3. Rate Locations
        ◦ Simple rating system (stars, thumbs-up, or emojis) to give quick feedback.
    4. CitySync Map
        ◦ An interactive map that shows user-recommended spots nearby or in any city.
